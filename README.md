# üíä SmartMedicationScheduler ‚Äì Offline Version

**SmartMedicationScheduler** is a Python project designed to help patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers **manage multiple medications safely and efficiently**. Many patients, particularly the elderly or those with chronic conditions, struggle to take their medicines correctly, which can lead to **missed doses, overdosing, or harmful drug interactions**. This tool provides a **personalized, intelligent schedule** based on the type of medication, its potency, and the medical condition it treats.

Users can input a list of medications they take. The program uses a **built-in medicine database** to determine **recommended timing for each dose**. It also checks for **drug interactions** between medications and generates **warnings** if any unsafe combinations exist. The final output is a clear, **hourly schedule** showing when to take each medication, along with actionable suggestions for safe consumption.

**SmartMedicationScheduler ‚Äì Offline Version** is fully contained in a **single Python file**, requiring no external libraries. This makes it **easy to run in any online Python compiler**, beginner-friendly, and perfect for quick deployment or demonstration purposes. The project is ideal for healthcare enthusiasts, developers, or students interested in creating practical, problem-solving applications in the healthcare domain.
